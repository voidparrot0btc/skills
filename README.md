# @aibtc/skills

Claude Code skills for Bitcoin, Stacks, and DeFi operations. Converted from [@aibtc/mcp-server](https://github.com/aibtcdev/aibtc-mcp-server).

Each skill is a self-contained directory with a `SKILL.md` (used by Claude Code to understand the skill) and one or more colocated TypeScript scripts (run with Bun). All scripts output JSON to stdout for Claude Code consumption.

## Community Agents (aibtc-agents/)

The [`aibtc-agents/`](./aibtc-agents/) directory is a community registry of agent configurations. Each subdirectory documents how a specific agent is set up: which skills it uses, wallet configuration, required environment variables, and which workflows it participates in.

- **[Template](./aibtc-agents/template/setup.md)** — Blank configuration to copy when adding your own agent
- **[arc0btc](./aibtc-agents/arc0btc/README.md)** — Reference configuration showing a complete, working agent setup
- **[secret-mars](./aibtc-agents/secret-mars/README.md)** — Autonomous loop agent with subagents and contribution mode
- **[spark0btc](./aibtc-agents/spark0btc/README.md)** — Dev tools agent that ships PRs, earns bounties, and scouts repos
- **[tiny-marten](./aibtc-agents/tiny-marten/README.md)** — Dispatch loop agent, ecosystem connector, ordinals trader
- **[testnet-explorer](./aibtc-agents/testnet-explorer/README.md)** — Read-only testnet reference configuration for safe exploration

To contribute your agent config, fork the repo, copy the template to `aibtc-agents/<your-handle>/README.md`, fill it in, and open a PR. See [`aibtc-agents/README.md`](./aibtc-agents/README.md) for full contribution guidelines.

## AGENT.md Convention

Every skill directory contains an `AGENT.md` file alongside its `SKILL.md`. Where `SKILL.md` describes the CLI interface for Claude Code to invoke the skill, `AGENT.md` defines the **subagent behavior** — the decision rules, prerequisites, safety checks, and output-handling patterns a subagent should follow when operating that skill autonomously.

```
skills/
  btc/
    SKILL.md    # CLI interface: subcommands, flags, JSON output format
    AGENT.md    # Subagent rules: when to check fees, UTXO safety, error handling
  wallet/
    SKILL.md
    AGENT.md
  ...           # Every skill directory follows this pattern
```

AGENT.md files are intentionally concise — typically one page — and focus on the guardrails and decision points that matter for autonomous operation.

## Architecture

```

### How Skills Work

Each skill script is a standalone [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) CLI program. Claude Code reads the `SKILL.md` to understand available subcommands and their options, then calls the script directly:

```bash
bun run btc/btc.ts fees
bun run stx/stx.ts get-balance --address SP1234...
bun run wallet/wallet.ts unlock --password mypassword
```

All scripts print a single JSON object to stdout. Errors are also output as JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Wallet is locked. Run: bun run wallet/wallet.ts unlock --password <password>" }
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

Each `SKILL.md` begins with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: btc
description: Bitcoin L1 operations — check balances, ...
user-invocable: false
arguments: balance | fees | utxos | transfer | get-cardinal-utxos | get-ordinal-utxos | get-inscriptions
entry: btc/btc.ts
requires: [wallet]
tags: [l1, write, requires-funds]
---
```

- `name` — Skill identifier
- `description` — What the skill does (used by Claude Code for discovery)
- `user-invocable: false` — Claude Code invokes skills internally, not users
- `arguments` — Pipe-separated list of subcommands
- `entry` — Path to the CLI script(s), relative to the repo root
- `requires` — Skills that must be set up first (e.g. `[wallet]`)
- `tags` — Controlled vocabulary for filtering: `read-only`, `write`, `mainnet-only`, `requires-funds`, `sensitive`, `infrastructure`, `defi`, `l1`, `l2`

### Shared Infrastructure (`src/lib/`)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `wallet.ts` | Load encrypted wallets, unlock with password, persist session |
| `config.ts` | Read and write `~/.aibtc/config.json` (API keys, active wallet, settings) |
| `network.ts` | Network helpers: mainnet/testnet URL selection, address validation |
| `stacks-api.ts` | Hiro Stacks API client with optional API key and custom URL support |
| `btc-api.ts` | Bitcoin API client: mempool.space (fees/UTXOs/broadcast) + Hiro Ordinals API |

## Prerequisites

### Runtime

All scripts run with [Bun](https://bun.sh). Install Bun:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/skills
bun install
```

### Wallet Setup

Most operations require an active, unlocked wallet. Create one, or import an existing wallet from a seed phrase:

```bash
# Create a new wallet
bun run wallet/wallet.ts create --name main --password yourpassword

# Or import an existing wallet from a seed phrase
bun run wallet/wallet.ts import --name main --mnemonic "word1 word2 ... word24" --password yourpassword

# Unlock the wallet before transactions
bun run wallet/wallet.ts unlock --password yourpassword

# Check wallet status
bun run wallet/wallet.ts status
```

> **Note:** Wallet mnemonics are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being written to disk at `~/.aibtc/`. Your password is never stored — keep it safe.

**Important:** Your seed phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your password. Back it up in a secure offline location before using the wallet for mainnet transactions.

### Optional: Hiro API Key

Without an API key, all Stacks API requests use public rate limits. For higher throughput, get a free API key at https://platform.hiro.so/ and configure it:

```bash
bun run settings/settings.ts set-hiro-api-key --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

### Network

Skills default to `testnet`. Set `NETWORK=mainnet` for mainnet operations:

```bash
NETWORK=mainnet bun run btc/btc.ts fees
```

Note: Some skills are mainnet-only (DeFi, ordinals inscription index, Pillar direct mode). These will return an error on testnet.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Create and unlock a wallet
bun run wallet/wallet.ts create --name main --password mypassword --network testnet
bun run wallet/wallet.ts unlock --password mypassword

# 3. Check wallet is ready
bun run wallet/wallet.ts status

# 4. Get current Bitcoin fee estimates
bun run btc/btc.ts fees

# 5. Check STX balance
bun run stx/stx.ts get-balance

# 6. Query Stacks network status
bun run query/query.ts get-network-status
```
